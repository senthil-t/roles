module:            configure SQL/MX Datasource

short_description: Manages SQL/MX Datasource.

description:    This module helps to add/remove a datasource on NonStop with the specified
                MX service and the datasource name. If the action is Add then the datasource will
                be added and started with provided service name. "delete" stops the datasource abruptly and deletes 
                the datasource.
